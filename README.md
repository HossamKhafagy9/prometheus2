# 1) How do I trigger a Prometheus alert?
To trigger a Prometheus alert, you need to define alerting rules in Prometheus configuration files. These alerting rules specify the conditions that should trigger an alert and the actions that should be taken when the alert is fired. The actions can be sending an email, SMS, or pushing a notification to a chat platform like Slack. 

# 2) What is the difference between node exporter and mysql exporter ?
Node exporter is a Prometheus exporter that collects system-level metrics from a node, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. MySQL exporter is a Prometheus exporter that collects metrics from a MySQL server. It exposes metrics such as connections, queries per second, and table cache hit rate. 

# 3) What is the maximum retention period to save data in Prometheus and how to increase it ?
The default retention period in Prometheus is 15 days. However, you can increase the retention period by modifying the storage configuration in Prometheus. The maximum retention period depends on the amount of storage available on your system. 

# 4) What are the different PromQL data types available in Prometheus Expression language?
The PromQL data types available in Prometheus Expression language are scalar, string, boolean, and instant and range vectors. 

# 5) How To calculate the average request duration over the last 5 minutes from a histogram ?
You can use the rate() function in PromQL to calculate the rate of change of a histogram over time. To calculate the average request duration over the last 5 minutes, you can use the following query:

avg(rate(my_histogram_bucket[5m])) 

# 6) What is Thanos Prometheus?
Thanos is a distributed system that extends Prometheus with long-term storage and high availability. It provides a global view of metrics across multiple Prometheus instances and allows for querying and visualizing data from multiple sources. 

# 7) What is promtool ?
Promtool is a command-line tool that comes with Prometheus. It is used for managing and validating Prometheus configurations, including validating alerting rules, checking for configuration errors, and linting YAML files. 

# 8) What types of Monitoring can be done via Grafana?
Grafana can be used for monitoring a wide range of systems and applications, including databases, web servers, cloud infrastructure, and IoT devices. It supports various data sources, including Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and InfluxDB, allowing for flexible and customizable visualizations of metrics data. 

# 9) Can we see different Servers CPU comparison in Grafana?
Yes, you can see different servers CPU comparison in Grafana by using the Prometheus data source and querying the metrics from the node exporter. You can then use Grafana's visualization features to create a graph that compares the CPU usage across multiple servers.
